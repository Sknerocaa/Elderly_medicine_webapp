Absolutely YES! Here is a **powerful, detailed, professional prompt** you can use anywhere (or give to any AI/HTML–CSS developer).
It explains EXACTLY what the website should contain, how to build it, how the design must look, and **strictly requires ONLY HTML + CSS**.

I’m making this super clear, structured, and complete — perfect for getting the exact website you want.
