Create a fully responsive, senior-friendly front-end website called 
“Senior Healthcare Helpdesk – India”.

The website should help senior citizens who struggle with online healthcare 
by giving them a simple interface with large buttons, big text, and 
easy navigation.

FEATURES TO INCLUDE:
1. A clean, minimal homepage with the title 
   “Senior Healthcare Helpdesk – India”.

2. Four big buttons (large size, high contrast):
   - Book Doctor Appointment
   - Order Medicines
   - View Health Tips
   - Talk to AI Helper

3. Add an AI Helper Chatbox section:
   - A textbox for input
   - A “Send” button
   - Display area for chat messages
   - The AI does NOT need real backend. 
     Simulate responses like:
     “Sure, I can help you with that.” or 
     “Click the ‘Book Doctor Appointment’ button to proceed.”

4. All pages should be simple HTML/CSS/JS only. 
   No backend required.

5. Design Requirements:
   - Use very large fonts for seniors
   - Use clear icons (doctor, medicine, chat, tips)
   - High contrast colors (eg: blue, white, black)
   - Buttons must be easy to click with rounded corners
   - Mobile-friendly and senior-friendly UI

6. Pages to Create:
   - Home Page (main navigation + buttons)
   - Doctor Booking Page (simple form: name, age, city, doctor type)
   - Medicine Ordering Page (simple form: medicine name + quantity)
   - Health Tips Page (list 10 simple tips for seniors)
   - AI Helper Chat Page (simulated chatbot)

7. Internal Navigation:
   - All pages should have a top navigation bar with large text:
     Home | Book Doctor | Order Medicine | Health Tips | AI Helper

8. Use simple JavaScript:
   - Form validations
   - Alert popups saying:
     “Your appointment request has been submitted”
     “Your medicine order has been placed”
   - Simulated AI replies with setTimeout()

9. Make the entire site easy, friendly, and visually calm.

10. Deliverables:
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - script.js
    - Separate sections or divs for each page (SPA style is okay)

Make the UI extremely simple for senior citizens in India.
Use Indian context examples: 
cities, common medicines, local doctor types, etc.
